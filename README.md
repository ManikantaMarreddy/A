The problem statement is to predict the percentage of a student based on the number of study hours and to calculate the predicted score if a student studies for 9.25 hours/day.
In this task, I have used R with stats library for machine learning to implement the regression function and caret library to check the accuracy and the error of the trained model.
This is a simple Linear regression task as it involves only 2 variables.
